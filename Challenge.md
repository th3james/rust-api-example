# eaglecore API programming challenge
Eaglecore is a product that records scientific experiments. Experiments consist of Investigations, which contain many Studies.

Your task is to attach the files in the directory `files-to-upload` to the corresponding studies on the server, using the eaglecore API. The files are named with a prefix which corresponds to the 'identifer' attributes of a study. You'll need to find the studies using the API, then upload the files.
